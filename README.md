# Threat-Intelligence-Analysis-Template

ðŸŽ‰ **How to use this template**

Building a threat intelligence program that is relevant, timely, actionable, and data-driven can be challenging. We have created two valuable templates for disseminating threat intel information to stakeholders. These templates include a detailed report and a short executive summary, both of which are essential for building a successful threat intelligence program.

ðŸ”…**Detailed Threat Analysis Template:** For any relevant topic, whether a timely news-related report or a nation-state yearly analysis, a detailed threat analysis is a full analysis of the situation and its relevance to the company, business, or product. This type of report is catered to an audience and stakeholder base interested in the details, background, and next steps and actions of the threat actor. It provides a comprehensive overview of the analyzed topic, including key points, evidence, and a bottom line up front (BLUF) summary. 

ðŸŽ¯ **Executive Threat Brief Template:** This is a  shortened, to-the-point summarization of the detailed report or a standalone brief about a piece of industry news that doesn't warrant a detailed report. This template can be used to communicate upwards to executive management and sideways to a broader stakeholder base- Physical security team, legal team, product team, other engineering team, customer support team, etc.
