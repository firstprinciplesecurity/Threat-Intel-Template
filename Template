### üéâ Key Points / Summary
This section should provide readers with a Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) of the purpose and findings of the brief. It should include the threat position (with confidence level and an assessment). It should also identify key points/evidence bullets that have helped frame the threat position and impact on the business. 
Confidence levels
This section is included for context and should be deleted when writing the brief. Confidence levels are applied to assessments to help provide context on how strong or weak the assessment may be. The confidence levels are typically chosen based on the information used to make the assessments:  
High Confidence: Your assessments are based on multiple sources, often corroborated that lead to sound judgments. A high confidence does not equate to complete accuracy, there is always some level of risk based on data, source, and methods used.
Medium Confidence: Your assessments are based on multiple sources with some corroboration. If the data was of higher quality or corroborated it would lead to higher confidence.  
Low Confidence: Your assessments are based on fragmented data or sources with varying degrees of fidelity. 
Remember to include an Appendix or Footnote explaining confidence levels in your document.
Perspective
This section describes and provides context of the threat(s) highlighted in the brief and how it relates to the bigger picture. Think of this section as framing -why this threat matters relative to your industry/business vertical/company/product. What you‚Äôll want to highlight is evidence if this threat is or isn‚Äôt in line with what is being observed in the industry and the potential impact to your organization. 
Gaps
The information we don't know and/or don‚Äôt have coverage to help make an assessment is traditionally categorized as known unknowns. List factors here that we are aware of, but we do not have available data or analysis to make an informed decision. In the context of threat intelligence analysis, known unknowns may include missing data points, gaps in knowledge about a specific threat actor or their methods, or an incomplete understanding of the context in which a threat is operating.
Recommendation and Next Steps 
Based on the detailed threat analysis, we recommend putting together a list of recommendations to strengthen the existing controls or highlight the lack of control investments if applicable in your overall security program.  We have created a chart that outlines the next steps, gaps, responsible stakeholders, and a continuation plan.  This chart will help you track the progress and ensure that the recommended actions are assigned and clear.

Example: Start collecting phishing metrics 
Corporate  Security, IT 
Pull phishing statistics 
Invest in a piece o technology to block or handle phishing attempts.









Outlook 
This section should highlight your assessment of whether the threat will likely increase, decrease, or remain the same in the near term (6-12 months), and list supporting evidence to substantiate this. Identify indicators or signals that could be used to determine if the threat is evolving, and state what this would signal. For example: if there is an increase in phishing targeting HR professionals, we assess whether the threat actor has shifted their technique, indicating newly implemented controls are working.  Ultimately, this section should paint a picture of where this threat leaves the company/industry.
